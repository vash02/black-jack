# Blackjack Game
This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic card game Blackjack (21) written in Python. The game allows a player to bet chips, receive two cards, and make decisions to either "hit" (draw a card) or "stand" (keep the current hand). The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The dealer follows a set of rules for drawing cards.

## How to Play
Clone the repository:
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/vash02/black-jack.git
</pre>

Navigate to the project directory:
<pre>
bash cd black-jack
</pre>

Run the game:
<pre>
bash python main.py
</pre>

Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Rules
Aces can count as either 1 or 11 points.
Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) count as 10 points.
The dealer hits until reaching a hand value of 17 or higher.
