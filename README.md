#Blackjack Game
This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic card game Blackjack (21) written in Python. The game allows a player to bet chips, receive two cards, and make decisions to either "hit" (draw a card) or "stand" (keep the current hand). The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The dealer follows a set of rules for drawing cards.
